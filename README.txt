== Description ==

= WordPress Plugin Makes It Easy To Use On Your Own Site! =
If you run your website on WordPress, you're in luck because we've created a plugin that makes it super easy to import your campaigns directly into your WordPress pages! We've worked hard to make sure you're branding isn't compromised!

## Here's What LeadKitPro Can Do For You! =
Have a peek below at a system that will remove every obstacle you have when creating and delivering your lead magnets and, ultimately, building your list.

= Create Entire Lead Capture Funnels! =  
Just start adding content and let LeadcoDyno showcase it for you in an easy to consume web-based format. Now, you'll never again have to search for graphic templates that you may or may not be able to use to showcase the information you want to share with your subscribers.

= Use Your Own Content & OPC (Other People's Content)! =  
Using our intuitive Medium-style editor, you can add images, video, stylized text and more instantly, and on the fly. In addition, using a simple technology format, you're able to embed content from around the web. Say good-bye to having to create your own unique content every time you want to create a lead magnet! Just paste links to any content online and our smart system will automatically embed it into your content.

= Customize Your Users' Experience! =  
LeadKitPro allows you to add up to 10 individual content sections giving you an easy way to organize everything to fit any kind of format. Each section may be designated as public or private content in order to give some content away as teaser material - generating good will and higher interest in the private content.

= Organize All Of Your Lead Capture Campaigns! =
Instead of having your lead magnets spread out all over the internet on different web pages and across blogs and sites...use LeadKitPro to keep all of your lead magnet content neatly organized in one place.

= Keep Your Content Updated And Relevant! =
Your lead magnets live online, so you can update them anytime - and your subscribers will always be able to see the most up-to-date version anytime!

= Automatically Connect With Your Email Service Provider! =
Give a little to get a lot. Make sure to take advantage of using the lock and unlock feature to show enough content to your public visitors and hide exclusive content for your subscribers. The good will you'll generate will attract your best prospects!
